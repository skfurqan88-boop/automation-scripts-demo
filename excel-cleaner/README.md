# Excel Cleaner

This script cleans a CSV file by trimming whitespace from each cell and removing empty rows. The cleaned output is saved as a new CSV file.

## How to run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place the input CSV file in an accessible location.
3. Run the script with the input file path.

Example:

```bash
python3 script.py data.csv -o output.csv
```

### Notes

- The default output file name is `output.csv` if you do not provide `-o`.
